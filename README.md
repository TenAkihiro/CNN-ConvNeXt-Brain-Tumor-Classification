# CNN-ConvNeXt-Brain-Tumor-Classification

This project compares the performance of models in classifying brain tumors using Transfer Learning with the ConvNext Architecture and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The models were optimized through hyperparameter tuning, focusing on the optimizer, learning rate, and dropout rate. In this project, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 99.54%, using the ConvNext-B architecture with the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 0.001, and a dropout rate of 0.25.
